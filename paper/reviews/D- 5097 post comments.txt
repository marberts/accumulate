Manuscript style comments:


o \section, \subsection, etc. should be in sentence style (see http://www.jstatsoft.org/about/submissions), e.g.,
2. Dynamic Grouping
3. R Package accumulate
4. Extensive Example: Economic Data
5. Formal Description and Algorithms
3.1. The Formula Interface
3.2. The Data Frame Interface
3.3. Specifying Tests
3.4. Balanced and Unbalanced Hierarchical Classiﬁcations
4.1. Small Area Estimation
4.2. Imputing Missing Values Using SAE and Ratio Imputation
4.3. Random Nearest Neighbours Imputation with Collapsing Groups
4.4. Computing Complex Aggregates

==> DONE


o For the code layout in R publications, we typically distinguish input/output
using Sinput/Soutput (or equivalently CodeInput/CodeOutput). Unless there are
special reasons to format it differently, the input should use the text width
(up to 76 or 77 characters) and be indented by two spaces, e.g., Do not start
each new line with a comma

begin{Sinput}
R> example_model <- lm(response ~ variable1 + variable2 + variable3, 
+    weights = w, data = mydata)
\end{Sinput}

> cumulate(input, collapse = A*B ~ A*B1 + A
+

>= 3,
> input$Y2 <- 11:19

> accumulate(input, collapse = A*B ~ A*B1 + A
+

> accumulate(input[-3], collapse = A*B ~ A
+

> input1 <-
> input1$AB <- paste(input$A, input$B, sep = "-"
> input1 <- input1[-(1:3)
> input1

==> DONE

o Code should have enough spaces to facilitate reading.  Please include spaces before and after operators and after commas (unless spaces have syntactical meaning).

==> DONE

o If using "e.g." and "i.e." add a comma after the period to keep LaTeX from interpreting them as the end of a sentence, i.e.: "e.g., " and "i.e., "

==> DONE


o The rule for capitalizing the starting letters of Figure, Section and Table
is as follows: If you are referring to a particular figure/section/table then
capitalize the first letter, otherwise use a lower-case first letter. For
example, something shown in Section 4 vs. there are three sections in this
paper. All of your figures and tables should be in the dedicated environment,
with proper captions and labels 

\begin{figure}
Figure
\caption{}
\label{}
\end{figure}

==> DONE. In particular, put the colorded tables in a figure environment and referred to the Figure.

o Figures, tables and equations should be marked with a \label and referred to by \ref, e.g., Figure~\ref{...}.

o All captions should appear below the corresponding figure/table. The captions should be in sentence style and end with a period.  No additional formatting (such as \emph, f or \it) should be used for the caption.

o All table row/column headers should also be in sentence style. There should not be further footnote-style annotations in tables; these should all be placed in the caption.

o Equations should be marked with a \label and referred to by either
	Equation~\ref{...} (with capitalization, without parentheses)
		or
	(\ref({...})
with the former being preferred if the number of equation references is not too large.


o Abbreviations should be spelled in upper-case letters without additional formatting (i.e., without periods, without small caps, italics, etc.).  All abbreviations should be introduced with their expansion where the expansion should not be capitalized.


o As a reminder, please make sure that:
	- \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout the paper (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.


References:



o As a reminder,
	- Please make sure that all software packages are \cite{}'d properly.

	- All references should be in title style.

	- See FAQ for specific reference instructions.


Code:

o As a reminder, please make sure that the files needed to replicate all code/examples within the manuscript are included in a standalone replication script.
